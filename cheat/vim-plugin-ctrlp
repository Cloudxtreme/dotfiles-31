# How to create directory and files with CtrlP?
Type in the non-existing directory or file name and press `C-y`.

# How to exclude certain files and directories in CtrlP?
CtrlP will ignore files and directories configured in the .gitignore files.
To exclude other files or directories in the file list, a quick way is to adopt the silver Searcher as the backend for this and use a .agignore file (just like the gitignore file) at the project level or global level `~/.agignore`.

The Silver Search can be installed on OSX with the following command:
`brew install the_silver_searcher`;

Then configure it in the `.vimrc` with the following line:
`let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'ag %s -l --nocolor --hidden -g ""'`

Finally, set up the `.agignore` file at the project level or local level.
